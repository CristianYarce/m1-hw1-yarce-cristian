## Issues
I  had issues when I tried to open VS from the console using "code ." because I used to run my code with atom and I had to configure it for VS. 
The console showed me an error with a link and it helped me.

This was another issue for me when i tried to run git push: 

``` code
$ git push
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.
remote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/CristianYarce/m1-hw1-yarce-cristian.git/'
```

I just needed to give access between github and my personal computer with vs.
